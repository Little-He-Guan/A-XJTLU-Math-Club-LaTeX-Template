\section{Tutorial 2: Delilah and Linear Algebra}
Delilah is working on a part of a material about linear algebra. As her work proceeds, she will obtain the ability to deal with complex mathematical formulae in \LaTeX{}, especially those methods provided by the ams packages loaded in xjtlumath.

\subsection{Multiple Lined Formulae}
A system of linear equations is a fundamental part of linear algebra. When Delilah tries to type a group of equations, she encounters a problem. In the predefined \verb=\[\]= and environment equation, she finds no option to start a new line. Even the line-break options of \LaTeX{} like \verb=\\= and \verb=\newline= do not work there. Of course the equations should not be put in one line, so what should she do now? Later she learns that the environment \emph{aligned} is designed to allow a system of equations to be aligned in multiple lines:

\begin{miniexammar}{.4\textandmarginlen}{
\[
\begin{aligned}
x+y &= 1\\
x-y &= 2
\end{aligned}
\]
}
\begin{lstlisting}
\[
\begin{aligned}
x+y &= 1\\
x-y &= 2
\end{aligned}
\]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{miniexammar}
Here, the ampersand sign \verb=&= is used before the symbols according to which the equations are to be aligned. The line break sign \verb=\\= starts a new line of equation. Note that other line-break operations cannot be used here.

Delilah likes the result, but she feels that the equations are too lonely. She thinks that adding a large curly bracket for them will comfort them. \LaTeX{} supports a syntax to put things before and after a group of things.

\begin{miniexammar}{.4\textandmarginlen}{
\[
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
x+y &= 1\\
x-y &= 2
\end{aligned}
\right.
\]
}
\begin{lstlisting}
\[
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
x+y &= 1\\
x-y &= 2
\end{aligned}
\right.
\]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{miniexammar}
The \verb=\left= command defines what is to be put on the left, and the \verb=\right= command defines what is to be put on the right. Delilah does not want to put anything on the right, so she writes \verb=.= for nothing.

For a group of equations that requires no alignment, or for a single equation that is too long to fit in one line, the environment \emph{gathered} that does no alignment is a better choice:

\begin{miniexammar}{.45\textandmarginlen}{
\[
\begin{gathered}
\cos {z} = 1 - \frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} - \frac{z^6}{6!} + \cdots \\
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty {\frac{(-1)^n z^{2n}}{(2n!)}}
\end{gathered}
\]
}
\begin{lstlisting}
\[
\begin{gathered}
\cos {z} = 1 - \frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} - \cdots \\
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty {\frac{(-1)^n z^{2n}}{(2n!)}}
\end{gathered}
\]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{miniexammar}

After writing several groups of equations, Delilah wants to reference one of them. She uses the equation environment instead of \verb=\[\]=, but finds out that the equations are numbered as a whole.

\begin{miniexammar}{.4\textandmarginlen}{
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
x+y &= 1\\
x-y &= 2
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
}
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
x+y &= 1\\
x-y &= 2
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{miniexammar}
So it is difficult for her to reference a single equation in a group. amsmath provides the environment align for this purpose:

\begin{miniexammar}{.4\textandmarginlen}{
\begin{align}
x+y &= 1\\
x-y &= 2
\end{align}
}
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{align}
x+y &= 1\\
x-y &= 2
\end{align}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{miniexammar}

If she doesn't want to number a single equation, she needs to append \verb=\nonumber= at the end of that line.
\begin{miniexammar}{.4\textandmarginlen}{
\begin{align}
x+y &= 1\\
z&=10 \nonumber\\
x-y &= 2
\end{align}
}
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{align}
x+y &= 1\\
z &= 10 \nonumber\\
x-y &= 2
\end{align}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{miniexammar}

Without the ``ed'' suffix, \emph{gather} is also a standalone environment that does what gathered do. But there is a major difference between them. Delilah finds it impossible to put the bracket again before a align or gather, because they don't need to but surrounded by mathematical environments. Also, their width are fixed to be the width of texts, while their ``ed''ed versions can be of any width.

As the same as the equation environment, their starred versions give no number by default.
\begin{miniexammar}{.4\textandmarginlen}{
\begin{align*}
x+y &= 1\\
x-y &= 2
\end{align*}
}
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{align*}
x+y &= 1\\
x-y &= 2
\end{align*}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{miniexammar}

Delilah is able to put multiple groups of equations in one align, just by adding ampersands between the groups.
\begin{miniexammar}{.4\textandmarginlen}{
\begin{align*}
x+y &= 1  & a+b &= 3\\
x-y &= 2  & a-b &= 4
\end{align*}
}
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{align*}
x+y &= 1  & a+b &= 3\\
x-y &= 2  & a-b &= 4
\end{align*}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{miniexammar}
The space between the groups is adjusted automatically by align.

\subsection{Matrices}
Matrices are vital to linear algebra, as they represent linear mappings from a vector space to another in specific bases. Also, the coefficient matrix and the augmented matrix are convenient in operating linear equations.

amsmath provides several environments for typing matrices.
\begin{miniexammar}{.5\textandmarginlen}{
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1&2&3&4\\
5&6&7&8\\
9&10&11&12\\
13&14&15&16
\end{bmatrix}
\]
}
\begin{lstlisting}
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1&2&3&4\\
5&6&7&8\\
9&10&11&12\\
13&14&15&16
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{miniexammar}
The environments pmatrix, Bmatrix, vmatrix, and Vmatrix produce delimiters of \verb=()=, \verb={}=, \verb=||=, and \verb=|| ||=, respectively.

To use matrices in inline mode, Delilah uses the environment smallmatrix, which has no p,b,B,v,V versions in amsmath, as it is the author's responsibility to decide the delimiters.
\begin{miniexammar}{.4\textandmarginlen}{
The matrix $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} a&b\\c&d \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ is so small and cute!
}
\begin{lstlisting}
The matrix $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} a&b\\c&d \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ is so small and cute!
\end{lstlisting}
\end{miniexammar}

When Delilah tries to put fractions inside a matrix, she finds something annoying.
\begin{miniexammar}{.3\textandmarginlen}{
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1&\frac{1}{2}&\frac{1}{3}\\
1&\frac{1}{4}&\frac{1}{5}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
}
\begin{lstlisting}
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1&\frac{1}{2}&\frac{1}{3}\\
1&\frac{1}{4}&\frac{1}{5}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{miniexammar}
The fractions above and below are so close that they touch each other! This is not what Delilah wants and she is surprised that \LaTeX{} doesn't detect this and do something. Fortunately, in amsmath environments, an optional argument is allowed to be passed to \verb=\\= to define the actual vertical space between lines. For fractions, 2ex is a good option. Also, the fractions are in inline mode. The \verb=\dfrac= command gives displayed fractions.
\begin{miniexammar}{.3\textandmarginlen}{
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1&\dfrac{1}{2}&\dfrac{1}{3}\\[2ex]
1&\dfrac{1}{4}&\dfrac{1}{5}
\end{bmatrix}
\]
}
\begin{lstlisting}
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1&\dfrac{1}{2}&\dfrac{1}{3}\\[2ex]
1&\dfrac{1}{4}&\dfrac{1}{5}
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{miniexammar}

Sometimes a matrix is too large to be displayed fully. At these times, the use of ellipses (plural of ellipsis, not ellipse) is important. When Delilah writes the inverse of a matrix, she uses ellipses.
\begin{miniexammar}{.5\textandmarginlen}{
\[
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A}
\begin{bmatrix}
C_{11} & C_{21} & \cdots & C_{n1} \\
C_{12} & C_{22} & \cdots & C_{n2} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
C_{n2} & C_{n2} & \cdots & C_{nn} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
}
\begin{lstlisting}
\[
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A}
\begin{bmatrix}
C_{11} & C_{21} & \cdots & C_{n1} \\
C_{12} & C_{22} & \cdots & C_{n2} \\
\vdots & C\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
C_{n2} & C_{n2} & \cdots & C_{nn} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{miniexammar}

\subsection{Texts and Operator Names}
To put text inside math environments, Delilah uses the \verb=\text= command provided by amsmath.
\begin{miniexammar}{.57\textandmarginlen}{
\begin{definition}[Null Space]
The null space of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$, written as $\Nul A$, is the set of all solutions
of the homogeneous equation $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$. In set notation,
\[
\Nul A = \{\vec{x}:\vec{x} \text{ is in } \mathbb{R}^n \text{ and } A\vec{x} = \vec{0} \}
\]
\end{definition}
}
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{definition}[Null Space]
The null space of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$, written as $\Nul A$, is the set of all solutions
of the homogeneous equation $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$. In set notation,
\[
\Nul A = \{\vec{x}:\vec{x} \text{ is in } \mathbb{R}^n \text{ and } A\vec{x} = \vec{0} \}
\]
\end{definition}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{miniexammar}

The commands like \verb=\Nul=, \verb=\sin=, ... are math operators. Part of predefined math operators in \LaTeX{} are shown in Table \ref{tab:predefmathop}.
\begin{table}[hbpt]
\begin{center}
\small
\begin{tabular}{cl|cl|cl}
Result & Command & Result & Command & Result & Command \\
\hline
arccos & \verb=\arccos= & arcsin & \verb=\arcsin= & arctan & \verb=\arctan= \\
cos & \verb=\cos= & sin & \verb=\sin= & tan & \verb=\tan= \\
cot & \verb=\cot= & sec & \verb=\sec= & csc & \verb=\csc= \\
cosh & \verb=\cosh= & sinh & \verb=\sinh= & tanh & \verb=\tanh= \\
lim & \verb=\lim= & lim inf & \verb=\liminf= & lim sup & \verb=\limsup= \\
ln & \verb=\ln= & log & \verb=\log= & lg & \verb=\lg= \\
max & \verb=\max= & min & \verb=\min= & sup & \verb=\sup= \\
inf & \verb=\inf= &  &  &  &  \\
ker & \verb=\ker= & det & \verb=\det= & exp & \verb=\exp= 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Some Predefined Math Operators}
\label{tab:predefmathop}
\end{table}

In fact, operator \verb=\Nul= and \verb=\Span= are defined by xjtlumath as in the forms in the year 1 linear algebra textbook of XJTLU. Also, xjtlumath changes the default \verb=\vec= command in \LaTeX{} so that vectors appear in bold form rather than with a arrow above them.
